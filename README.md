# Aquatic-Species-Thresholds

All code is used in a project that attempts to predict species distribution based on limiting stressors and identify minimum and maximum stressor thresholds for each species-stressor combo. The goal is to create a tool that can be used in stream restoration planning to determine potential ecological uplift for a stream so that restoration efforts can be targeted to locations where they will have the most potential benefit or uplift and expands upon the work of Hilderbrand and Utz (UMCES).
